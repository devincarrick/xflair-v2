# Dependency Vulnerabilities Status

## Overview
This document summarizes the current known dependency vulnerabilities in the project, the reasons they remain unresolved, and the steps being taken to monitor and address them.

## Current Situation
After running `npm audit fix --force` and updating dependencies, the following vulnerabilities remain:

- 15 vulnerabilities (8 moderate, 7 high) as of the last update.
- These vulnerabilities are primarily in deeply nested dependencies, especially within the Vercel ecosystem (e.g., `vercel`, `@vercel/node`, `@vercel/redwood`, `@vercel/remix`, etc.).
- Some deprecated packages are also present due to upstream dependencies.

## Why Vulnerabilities Remain
- The vulnerable packages are dependencies of other packages that have not yet updated their own dependencies.
- Further forced updates would only be possible if the maintainers of those packages release new versions with updated dependencies.
- Some deprecated packages are also still present for the same reason.

## Mitigation & Monitoring
- The project maintainers are monitoring upstream repositories for updates that address these vulnerabilities.
- Regularly running `npm audit` and `npm outdated` to check for new releases and vulnerability fixes.
- Reviewing the actual risk of these vulnerabilities in the context of the project (e.g., whether they are only in dev dependencies, or exploitable in production).
- Using `npm audit --production` to focus on production dependencies.

## Next Steps
- Continue to monitor for updates to upstream packages.
- Re-run `npm audit fix` and update dependencies as new versions become available.
- Document any changes or resolutions in this file.
